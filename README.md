### Author

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description
This project is a calculator with basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, sin(degrees), cos(degrees) and an additional operation Bitcoin (Given a bitcoin value, obtain the current dollar value), which requires online connectivity and a call to the Cryptocompare API: https://min-api.cryptocompare.com

This app also has settings, where users can enable or disable operations visibility in UI and also change the color palette of the app. 

The interface works on iPhones and iPads. Both landscape and portrait orientation are supported.

Error handling: All errors display with a simple message to the user and print to the console for debugging purposes.

Internet connectivity: NWPathMonitor (Does not work correctly on the simulator. Test only on the real device)

All user settings are saved via UserDefaults.
